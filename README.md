You may have a few empty blocks spawned already. If that's the case, simply drag them to the trash can. 

This was made using Materialize CSS, jscolor for the color picker (http://jscolor.com/), and jQuery UI.

I did not use the jQuery .draggable() function, and instead coded the draggable portion myself.
